  # Route traffic based on the host header. 
  # Since we access via localhost:8080, we don't need a specific host.
  # Using a wildcard or omitting the host works, but explicitly targeting 
  # traffic potentially helps if other Ingresses exist.
  # Let's keep it simple and route all traffic handled by this Ingress.
